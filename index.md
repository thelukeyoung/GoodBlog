Technology has been the foundation of human development and improvement and this 
improvement has increased exponentiallythroughout time. The telegraph is a 
great example of one of these technologies.It made communication much faster 
and allowed for morepeople to communicate with each other. It also over the 
span of its life the telegraph helped format railroad trade as 
well as establish better time zones (which was necessary with the greater distances 
the telegraph messages carried) (Carey 19-21). However, Corporations saw the 
invention of the telegraph as a means For wealth . In Technology and Ideology: The Case
of the Telegraph (James W. Carey 2009), it talks about how companies began to monopolize 
the telegraph and with that gain the powerof controlling communication through the 
telegraph. (Carey 2). The initial response of corporate entities was to capitalize on 
the profits of the new technology. When reading this it made me realize how power 
hungry entities focus on technology to get power whether it is firearms or satellites.

When technology is introduced it has a domino effect changing major things that are 
around it that are not only directly relatedbut indirectly related. 
This process of change is however inevitably halted by 
corporations and government once society becomes heavily reliant upon 
the technology. In The Master Switch written (Tim Wu 2011) it goes into 
detail about this, “History shows a typical progression of information
technologies: from somebody's hobby to somebody's industry: from jury-rigged 
contraption to slick production model; from a freely accessible channel to
one stricly controlled by a single corporation or cartel---From open to closed
system” (Wu 6). Essentially with this open to closed system technology seems 
that it can never achieve its full potential. The open to closed system has 
made it more and more difficult to improve technology especially in the modern era of 
technology because all technology is patented now by this major companies or
government bodies often not allowing much improvementto be made by outside entities.
Furthermore, without this competition from outside entities there is less 
incentive to develop new and more advanced technology since they control the market.

##Week 4

In this weeks reading and videos I found that Shoshana Zuboff keynote speech on surveillance capitalism was one of the most
interesting. The idea that the internet has been ingrained so heavily into the internet that almost everything you access 
online is used to sell you a product. This in my head is a complete violation of privacy.This made me think of the facebook
scandal where information was used to advertise on the site. Google also has been a culperite in the surveillance capitalism 
scene. They have been known to use people's search history to market ads based on what the individuals seems to be interested
in. I think in a way this is not a bad thing it is just marketing towards a demographic that should be likely to purchase the
product. However, I don't believe any corporate entities should have access to private information that said company did not
have permission to use. The internet is a lot more regulated than it previously was but company's know that this is a gray area
where they can abuse this and turn a prophet. Our information is being sold and traded between companies and this needs to be 
regulated to allow some information on the internet completely privately or outlaw what companies can used. Another big issue 
here is that if companies can access this information without you even being affiliated with them then what is stopping anyone
from viewing this information? With the past history of icloud accounts being hacked into and the releasement of different 
explicit images that individuals did not what out there publically. There is a correlation here because it is not a direct use
of private information to hurt or slander but it is a misuse of private information that these companies should not have access
too. As a result of this there simply needs to be a change to how companies market based off of other people's information. 

	Another video I found interesting was the Edward Snowden: the whistleblower behind the NSA surveillance revelations video in
  which he discusses the leaking of NSA information because practices he found of surveillance he did not believe were right. 
  Snowden believes he is completely just in his actions and I have to agree. In the US society free freedom is preached so 
  heavily as well as the right to protest him releasing this information which he did not believe to be just practice by the
  government is completely reasonable and the only legitimate security issue of this is other countries possibly figuring out 
  how we did surveillance. However, the American people needed to know the truth about how we have all been being monitored.
  This whole NSA surveillance idea was also a big concern before the whole this whole snowden event. The idea of big brother 
  looking down and over you as a means of control has been around forever. Without Snowden united states citizens would be 
  ignorant of how close this ideology of big brother is coming to fruition.
