Technology has been the foundation of human development and improvement and this 
improvement has increased exponentiallythroughout time. The telegraph is a 
great example of one of these technologies.It made communication much faster 
and allowed for morepeople to communicate with each other. It also over the 
span of its life the telegraph helped format railroad trade as 
well as establish better time zones (which was necessary with the greater distances 
the telegraph messages carried) (Carey 19-21). However, Corporations saw the 
invention of the telegraph as a means For wealth . In Technology and Ideology: The Case
of the Telegraph (James W. Carey 2009), it talks about how companies began to monopolize 
the telegraph and with that gain the powerof controlling communication through the 
telegraph. (Carey 2). The initial response of corporate entities was to capitalize on 
the profits of the new technology. When reading this it made me realize how power 
hungry entities focus on technology to get power whether it is firearms or satellites.

When technology is introduced it has a domino effect changing major things that are 
around it that are not only directly relatedbut indirectly related. 
This process of change is however inevitably halted by 
corporations and government once society becomes heavily reliant upon 
the technology. In The Master Switch written (Tim Wu 2011) it goes into 
detail about this, “History shows a typical progression of information
technologies: from somebody's hobby to somebody's industry: from jury-rigged 
contraption to slick production model; from a freely accessible channel to
one stricly controlled by a single corporation or cartel---From open to closed
system” (Wu 6). Essentially with this open to closed system technology seems 
that it can never achieve its full potential. The open to closed system has 
made it more and more difficult to improve technology especially in the modern era of 
technology because all technology is patented now by this major companies or
government bodies often not allowing much improvementto be made by outside entities.
Furthermore, without this competition from outside entities there is less 
incentive to develop new and more advanced technology since they control the market.

##Week 4

In this weeks reading and videos I found that Shoshana Zuboff keynote speech on 
surveillance capitalism wasone of the mostinteresting. The idea that the internet
has been ingrained so heavily into the internet that almost everything you access 
online is used to sell you a product. This in my head is a complete violation of
privacy.This made me think of the facebook scandal where information was used to 
advertise on the site. Google also has been a culperite in the surveillance capitalism 
scene. They have been known to use people's search history to market ads based on
what the individuals seems to be interestedin. I think in a way this is not a bad 
thing it is just marketing towards a demographic that should be likely to purchase the
product. However, I don't believe any corporate entities should have access to private
information that said company did nothave permission to use. The internet is a lot more
regulated than it previously was but company's know that this is a gray areawhere they
can abuse this and turn a prophet. Our information is being sold and traded between 
companies and this needs to be regulated to allow some information on the internet 
completely privately or outlaw what companies can used. Another big issue here is 
that if companies can access this information without you even being affiliated with
them then what is stopping anyone from viewing this information? With the past history
of icloud accounts being hacked into and the releasement of different explicit images
that individuals did not what out there publically. There is a correlation here because
it is not a direct use of private information to hurt or slander but it is a misuse of
private information that these companies should not have accesstoo. As a result of this
there simply needs to be a change to how companies market based off of other people's 
information. 

	Another video I found interesting was the Edward Snowden: the whistleblower behind
the NSA surveillance revelations video in which he discusses the leaking of NSA information
because practices he found of surveillance he did not believe were Snowden believes he is 
completely just in his actions and I have to agree. In the US society free freedom is
preached so heavily as well as the right to protest him releasing this information which he
did not believe to be just practice by thegovernment is completely reasonable and the only 
legitimate security issue of this is other countries possibly figuring out how we did 
surveillance. However, the American people needed to know the truth about how we have all 
been being monitored This whole NSA surveillance idea was also a big concern before the 
whole this whole snowden event. The idea of big brother  looking down and over you as a 
means of control has been around forever. Without Snowden united states citizens would be
ignorant of how close this ideology of big brother is coming to fruition.

##Week 5

In the readings this week the I found the first article in the LA Times
Your job is about to get ‘taskified’ by  MARY L. GRAY to be very interesting
. In the article, it discussed the movement from the typical nine to five 
job to more tasked based jobs such as Grub hub where you are paid based off
a single task at a rate for that single job. This makes it so that people are
able to work whenever they need to since the products that these companies sell
are basically always in demand. The issue with this is job security and steady
pay for consistent action. As the world becomes more automated the less need 
there is for these nine to fives with consistent workdays because machines 
are simply way better at these tasks than us humans. However, the skills it
takes to do these “taskified” jobs such as intuition when finding a specific
building that may be labeled incorrectly is much more suited for human beings.
This is an issue I believe because it is going to slowly turn human beings 
into simple tools in specific positions. While machines will essentially be
working the nine to five jobs. A counter to this could be that machines are 
just taking the less critical thinking jobs such as being a factory worker and
this will just push human beings to use more intellect inside of force. This 
would be a valid argument but not everyone is capable of these positions that
are able to be automated and I don't believe that just because of that they 
shouldn't be allowed to have a stable job as the previous generations of workers
before they had. I believe in capitalism and I do understand that it is the most
cost-efficient way to produce goods and transport them is to automate but I believe
with greater automatization the less social and human our society becomes. It still
has yet to be seen what effects of this “taskified” type of work has on the world
but there are definitely a lot of concerns. The one way I believe we could break 
up this “taskified” era before it really starts would be creating a system such as
a union for these types of companies to create a viable life based off the income as
well as some benefits such as retirement.
