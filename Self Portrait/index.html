<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>	This is my Self-Portrait. It was created using the brackets text editor and received plenty of help through www.w3school.com through use of online tutorials. In this project, I created an interactive display of multiple photos along with the interface which this explanation is being displayed on. The display of images tracks with my developmental years, through my adolescence, and to the present. To create the format of these images I used a tutorial for posting images on a webpage from w3school. After I was able to create an image I learned to make the page interactive in a way that if you are to hover over the image with the cursor the image would fade into text. Once I was able to create this I copied the body code multiple times as needed to place the of pictures I wanted. From there I placed my images in and put my specific text to each picture. I placed the date in which the pictures were taken and I did this with the fade effect to show that the date and time may have faded away but the events that occurred are static and have made up who I am as a collective today. I chose my images the way I did because they were all major milestones in my life and the periods between them are the major periods that make up my life. The first image is of me as an infant were life was brand new and was as simple as being taken care of by others. The second image is during my toddler/preschool era where life was gaining depth. I was beginning to have social interaction and began to do more on my own. The third image is of me during elementary school where I began playing sports as well as participating in clubs and such. This is when I began to learn morals and have consequences for my own actions which helped shaped my character today. The fourth image is me in middle school where I began to experiment in life and push some boundaries. Good or bad I learned multiple lessons from it. The fifth picture is me entering my freshman year where I began taking football very seriously and knew I could build something if I worked hard in both football and the classroom. The sixth picture is my highschool graduation where I ended my highschool career and was heading into the adult world were I now would have complete responsibility for everything that I have done and will do. The seventh picture is of my first day at UCLA where I have currently started my era here. It is the first time I am living away from home and in a completely new area with different situations and unlimited opportunities. What I do in this era is unknown so far but whatever I do end up doing it will be just another chapter in my self-portrait.
