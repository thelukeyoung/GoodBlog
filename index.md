Technology has been the foundation of human development and improvement and this 
improvement has increased exponentiallythroughout time. The telegraph is a 
great example of one of these technologies.It made communication much faster 
and allowed for morepeople to communicate with each other. It also over the 
span of its life the telegraph helped format railroad trade as 
well as establish better time zones (which was necessary with the greater distances 
the telegraph messages carried) (Carey 19-21). However, Corporations saw the 
invention of the telegraph as a means For wealth . In Technology and Ideology: The Case
of the Telegraph (James W. Carey 2009), it talks about how companies began to monopolize 
the telegraph and with that gain the powerof controlling communication through the 
telegraph. (Carey 2). The initial response of corporate entities was to capitalize on 
the profits of the new technology. When reading this it made me realize how power 
hungry entities focus on technology to get power whether it is firearms or satellites.

When technology is introduced it has a domino effect changing major things that are 
around it that are not only directly relatedbut indirectly related. 
This process of change is however inevitably halted by 
corporations and government once society becomes heavily reliant upon 
the technology. In The Master Switch written (Tim Wu 2011) it goes into 
detail about this, “History shows a typical progression of information
technologies: from somebody's hobby to somebody's industry: from jury-rigged 
contraption to slick production model; from a freely accessible channel to
one stricly controlled by a single corporation or cartel---From open to closed
system” (Wu 6). Essentially with this open to closed system technology seems 
that it can never achieve its full potential. The open to closed system has 
made it more and more difficult to improve technology especially in the modern era of 
technology because all technology is patented now by this major companies or
government bodies often not allowing much improvementto be made by outside entities.
Furthermore, without this competition from outside entities there is less 
incentive to develop new and more advanced technology since they control the market.
